To design a UI in Android by dragging elements into the screen, you can use Android Studio's Layout Editor. Here are the steps to create a simple UI:

1. Create a new project: Open Android Studio and create a new project.

2. Open the Layout Editor: In the `res` folder, open the `layout` folder and double-click on the `activity_main.xml` file to open the Layout Editor.

3. Drag elements into the screen: In the Palette, drag and drop elements into the screen to design your UI. For example, you can drag and drop a Button, TextView, EditText, etc.

4. Set properties of the elements: To set properties of the elements, select the element in the Design or Component Tree view and modify its properties in the Properties panel. For example, you can set the text of a TextView or Button, the background color of a View, etc.

5. Arrange and align elements: To arrange and align elements, you can use the Layout Editor's tools. For example, you can use the Layout Editor's guidelines and constraints to align elements.

6. Preview the layout: You can preview the layout on different devices by clicking on the Preview button in the Layout Editor.

7. Save the layout: Once you're satisfied with your layout, save the changes by clicking on the Save button or using the Ctrl+S keyboard shortcut.

Note: It's important to use proper layout containers, such as LinearLayout or RelativeLayout, to arrange and align elements properly.
