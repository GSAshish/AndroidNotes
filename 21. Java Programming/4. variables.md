container for a data value

you also need to assign a data Type

int mynum; //decleartion
`int myNum=0;`

Sure, here are examples of data declaration and definition for all primitive data types in Java:

1. `byte` data type:

Declaration without definition:

```java
byte b;
```

Declaration with definition:

```java
byte b = 100;
```

2. `short` data type:

Declaration without definition:

```java
short s;
```

Declaration with definition:

```java
short s = 1000;
```

3. `int` data type:

Declaration without definition:

```java
int i;
```

Declaration with definition:

```java
int i = 100000;
```

4. `long` data type:

Declaration without definition:

```java
long l;
```

Declaration with definition:

```java
long l = 100000000L;
```

Note that `L` is appended to the end of the number to indicate that it is a `long` data type.

5. `float` data type:

Declaration without definition:

```java
float f;
```

Declaration with definition:

```java
float f = 3.14f;
```

Note that `f` is appended to the end of the number to indicate that it is a `float` data type.

6. `double` data type:

Declaration without definition:

```java
double d;
```

Declaration with definition:

```java
double d = 3.14159;
```

7. `char` data type:

Declaration without definition:

```java
char c;
```

Declaration with definition:

```java
char c = 'A';
```

8. `boolean` data type:

Declaration without definition:

```java
boolean b;
```

Declaration with definition:

```java
boolean b = true;
```

Note that `true` or `false` are the only possible values for a `boolean` data type.
