In Java, an interface is a collection of abstract methods (methods with no implementation) and constants (fields with values that cannot be changed). An interface defines a contract that a class must implement in order to use the interface's methods and constants.

Here is an example of an interface:

```java
public interface Shape {
    double getArea();
    double getPerimeter();
}
```

In this example, the `Shape` interface defines two abstract methods (`getArea()` and `getPerimeter()`) that must be implemented by any class that implements the `Shape` interface.

To implement an interface, a class must use the `implements` keyword followed by the name of the interface. For example:

```java
public class Rectangle implements Shape {
    private double width;
    private double height;

    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    public double getArea() {
        return width * height;
    }

    public double getPerimeter() {
        return 2 * (width + height);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Rectangle` class implements the `Shape` interface by providing implementations for the `getArea()` and `getPerimeter()` methods. This allows the `Rectangle` class to be used anywhere a `Shape` object is expected.

Interfaces can also be extended, which means that one interface can inherit the methods and constants of another interface. For example:

```java
public interface Drawable {
    void draw();
}

public interface Shape extends Drawable {
    double getArea();
    double getPerimeter();
}
```

In this example, the `Shape` interface extends the `Drawable` interface, which means that any class that implements `Shape` must also implement the `draw()` method from `Drawable`.

Interfaces are an important part of Java's object-oriented programming model, as they provide a way to define a contract that can be implemented by multiple classes in a consistent way. They are widely used in Java's standard libraries, and many third-party libraries and frameworks also use interfaces extensively.
