Method overloading is a feature in Java that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name, but different parameter lists. This enables the same method name to be used for different operations, based on the type, number, and order of the parameters passed.

To overload a method in Java, you need to define two or more methods with the same name in the same class, but with different parameter lists. The methods must have different numbers, types, or order of parameters.

Here is an example of method overloading in Java:

```java
public class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Calculator` class has three `add` methods, each with a different parameter list. The first method takes two integers and returns an integer, the second method takes two doubles and returns a double, and the third method takes three integers and returns an integer. All three methods have the same name, but they perform different operations based on the parameter types and counts.

When calling an overloaded method, the compiler determines which version of the method to call based on the number, type, and order of the arguments passed. For example, calling `add(2, 3)` would invoke the first method, while calling `add(2.0, 3.0)` would invoke the second method.

Method overloading is useful for creating methods with similar functionality that differ in the type of data they operate on. It makes code more readable and easier to maintain by providing a consistent naming convention for related methods.

# compile-time polymorphism
Method overloading is also commonly referred to as "compile-time polymorphism" or "static polymorphism" in Java. This is because the compiler determines which version of the overloaded method to call based on the number, type, and order of the arguments passed at compile time, rather than at runtime. 

# runtime polymorphism

In contrast, "runtime polymorphism" or "dynamic polymorphism" is achieved through inheritance and method overriding, where the implementation of a method is determined at runtime based on the type of the object that it is called on. 

So while method overloading and method overriding are both examples of polymorphism in Java, they differ in the way that the specific implementation of the method is determined.
