In Java, a method is a block of code that performs a specific task. Methods are used to encapsulate behavior and can be called by other parts of the program, allowing for code reuse and modularity. A method can have parameters, which are values that are passed to the method, and it can also return a value.

Here is an example of a method in Java:

```java
public class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = addNumbers(5, 10);
        System.out.println("The sum of 5 and 10 is: " + sum);
    }

    public static int addNumbers(int a, int b) {
        int result = a + b;
        return result;
    }
}
```

In this example, we have defined a method named `addNumbers` that takes two integer parameters `a` and `b` and returns their sum. The `main` method calls the `addNumbers` method with arguments `5` and `10` and assigns the result to a variable named `sum`. The `System.out.println` statement then prints the result to the console.

Here are some key parts of a method in Java:

1. Access modifier: Specifies the visibility of the method. The four access modifiers in Java are `public`, `protected`, `private`, and package-private.

2. Return type: Specifies the data type of the value that the method returns. If the method does not return a value, the return type is `void`.

3. Method name: Specifies the name of the method.

4. Parameter list: Specifies the parameters that the method takes. Parameters are separated by commas and are enclosed in parentheses.

5. Method body: Contains the code that is executed when the method is called.

Here is an example of a method with different access modifiers:

```java
public class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result1 = myPublicMethod(5, 10);
        int result2 = myProtectedMethod(5, 10);
    }

    public static int myPublicMethod(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    protected static int myProtectedMethod(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;
    }

    private static int myPrivateMethod(int a, int b) {
        return a - b;
    }
}
```

In this example, we have defined three methods with different access modifiers. The `myPublicMethod` method is declared as `public`, which means it can be accessed from any class. The `myProtectedMethod` method is declared as `protected`, which means it can only be accessed from the same class or from a subclass. The `myPrivateMethod` method is declared as `private`, which means it can only be accessed from the same class.

Note that static methods can be called without creating an instance of the class, while instance methods require an instance of the class to be created before they can be called. In the examples above, we have defined static methods. To define an instance method, you simply remove the `static` keyword from the method declaration.


# parameter vs argument

In Java (and many other programming languages), the terms "argument" and "parameter" are often used interchangeably, but they have slightly different meanings.

A parameter is a variable that is declared as part of a method signature. It is used to receive a value that is passed into the method when it is called. Here's an example:

```java
public static void sayHello(String name) {
    System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
```

In this example, `name` is a parameter of the `sayHello` method. When the method is called, a value is passed in for `name`, like this:

```java
sayHello("Alice");
```

Here, `"Alice"` is the argument that is passed in for the `name` parameter.

So, in summary, a parameter is a variable in a method declaration that is used to receive a value that is passed into the method when it is called.

An argument, on the other hand, is the actual value that is passed into a method when it is called. So in the example above, `"Alice"` is an argument that is passed in for the `name` parameter.

Here's another example:

```java
public static int addNumbers(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

In this example, `a` and `b` are parameters of the `addNumbers` method. When the method is called, values are passed in for `a` and `b`, like this:

```java
int sum = addNumbers(3, 5);
```

Here, `3` and `5` are arguments that are passed in for the `a` and `b` parameters.

So in summary, the main difference between an argument and a parameter is that a parameter is a variable in a method declaration, while an argument is the actual value that is passed into a method when it is called.
