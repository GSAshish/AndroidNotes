In Java, `if`, `if-else`, and `if-else-if` are conditional statements that allow you to execute different blocks of code based on different conditions.

1. `if` statement:

The `if` statement allows you to execute a block of code if a condition is true. If the condition is false, the block of code is skipped. The syntax for the `if` statement is as follows:

```java
if (condition) {
    // code to execute if condition is true
}
```

For example:

```java
int x = 10;
if (x > 5) {
    System.out.println("x is greater than 5");
}
```

In this example, the `if` statement checks whether `x` is greater than 5. Since the condition is true, the message "x is greater than 5" is printed to the console.

2. `if-else` statement:

The `if-else` statement allows you to execute one block of code if a condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false. The syntax for the `if-else` statement is as follows:

```java
if (condition) {
    // code to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // code to execute if condition is false
}
```

For example:

```java
int x = 3;
if (x > 5) {
    System.out.println("x is greater than 5");
} else {
    System.out.println("x is less than or equal to 5");
}
```

In this example, the `if` statement checks whether `x` is greater than 5. Since the condition is false, the message "x is less than or equal to 5" is printed to the console.

3. `if-else-if` statement:

The `if-else-if` statement allows you to execute different blocks of code based on multiple conditions. The conditions are checked in order, and the first condition that is true is executed. The syntax for the `if-else-if` statement is as follows:

```java
if (condition1) {
    // code to execute if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // code to execute if condition2 is true
} else {
    // code to execute if all conditions are false
}
```

For example:

```java
int x = 7;
if (x < 5) {
    System.out.println("x is less than 5");
} else if (x < 10) {
    System.out.println("x is between 5 and 10");
} else {
    System.out.println("x is greater than or equal to 10");
}
```

In this example, the `if` statement checks whether `x` is less than 5. Since the condition is false, the next condition is checked, which is whether `x` is less than 10. Since this condition is true, the message "x is between 5 and 10" is printed to the console.
