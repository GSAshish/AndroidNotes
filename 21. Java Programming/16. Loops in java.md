In Java, there are three types of loops: `for`, `while`, and `do-while`. Each of these loops has its own syntax and use cases.

1. `for` loop:

The `for` loop is used when you know the number of iterations in advance. It is often used to iterate over arrays or collections. The syntax for the `for` loop is as follows:

```java
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

Here's an example that uses a `for` loop to print the numbers 1 to 10:

```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

In this example, the `for` loop starts with an initialization of `int i = 1`, which sets the starting value of the loop counter to 1. The loop continues to execute as long as the condition `i <= 10` is true. Each time the loop executes, the loop counter is incremented by 1 using the `i++` update statement.

2. `while` loop:

The `while` loop is used when you don't know the number of iterations in advance, but you do know the condition that must be met for the loop to continue. The syntax for the `while` loop is as follows:

```java
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

Here's an example that uses a `while` loop to print the numbers 1 to 10:

```java
int i = 1;
while (i <= 10) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
```

In this example, the `while` loop continues to execute as long as the condition `i <= 10` is true. Each time the loop executes, the loop counter is incremented by 1 using the `i++` statement.

3. `do-while` loop:

The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, except that the condition is checked at the end of the loop instead of at the beginning. This means that the code inside the loop will always execute at least once. The syntax for the `do-while` loop is as follows:

```java
do {
    // code to be executed
} while (condition);
```

Here's an example that uses a `do-while` loop to print the numbers 1 to 10:

```java
int i = 1;
do {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 10);
```

In this example, the `do-while` loop starts by executing the code inside the loop, which prints the value of `i` to the console and increments the loop counter by 1 using the `i++` statement. The loop continues to execute as long as the condition `i <= 10` is true. Since `i` starts at 1, the code inside the loop is guaranteed to execute at least once.

4. for Each
 
 `for-each` loop (also known as the enhanced `for` loop) is another type of loop in Java that is commonly used to iterate over arrays or collections. It was introduced in Java 5.0 as a simpler alternative to the traditional `for` loop.

The syntax for the `for-each` loop is as follows:

```java
for (elementType element : array) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

Here's an example that uses a `for-each` loop to iterate over an array of integers and print each element to the console:

```java
int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int num : nums) {
    System.out.println(num);
}
```

In this example, the `for-each` loop declares a new variable `num` of type `int` to hold each element in the `nums` array. The loop then iterates over the array and assigns each element to the `num` variable in turn. Finally, the code inside the loop prints the value of `num` to the console.
