In Java, static and non-static methods and variables have different behaviors when called. A static method or variable is associated with the class rather than any particular instance of the class, while a non-static method or variable is associated with a particular instance of the class.

When calling a static method or variable, you can refer to it directly using the class name, followed by a dot and the name of the method or variable:

```java
ClassName.staticMethodName();
ClassName.staticVariableName;
```

For example, if you have a class named `MathUtils` with a static method `add` and a static variable `PI`, you can call them like this:

```java
int sum = MathUtils.add(2, 3);
double piValue = MathUtils.PI;
```

When calling a non-static method or variable, you must first create an instance of the class, and then refer to the method or variable using the instance name:

```java
ClassName instanceName = new ClassName();
instanceName.nonStaticMethodName();
instanceName.nonStaticVariableName;
```

For example, if you have a class named `Person` with a non-static method `greet` and a non-static variable `name`, you can call them like this:

```java
Person person1 = new Person();
person1.name = "Alice";
person1.greet();
```

In this example, we first create an instance of the `Person` class called `person1`. We then set the `name` variable of `person1` to `"Alice"`. Finally, we call the `greet` method on `person1`.

It's important to note that static methods and variables can be called from non-static methods, but non-static methods and variables cannot be called from static methods without first creating an instance of the class.
