Encapsulation is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming, which is used to keep the internal state of an object hidden from the outside world. In Java, encapsulation is achieved using access modifiers to restrict access to the internal data of a class.

In Java, there are four access modifiers that can be used to control access to class members:

- `public`: The member can be accessed from any other class.
- `private`: The member can only be accessed from within the same class.
- `protected`: The member can be accessed from within the same class, as well as any subclasses and classes in the same package.
- `default` (no access modifier specified): The member can be accessed from within the same package.

By default, all class members (variables and methods) are `default` access, which means they can be accessed by any other class within the same package. To achieve encapsulation, we can use the `private` access modifier to restrict access to the internal state of a class.

For example, let's say we have a class called `Person` with two private instance variables, `name` and `age`:

```java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
    
    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

In this example, we have used the `private` access modifier to make the `name` and `age` instance variables private, so they cannot be accessed directly from outside the `Person` class. Instead, we have provided `public` getter and setter methods for each variable, which can be used to read and modify the internal state of a `Person` object.

Using getter and setter methods in this way helps to enforce encapsulation by ensuring that all access to the internal state of an object is performed through a well-defined interface, rather than directly accessing the object's variables. This makes it easier to maintain and modify the internal state of an object without affecting other parts of the program that depend on it.
