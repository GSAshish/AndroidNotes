There are four main types of Android components that are used to build applications:

1. Activities: Activities are the basic building blocks of Android applications. They represent a single screen with a user interface and are responsible for handling user interactions, such as button clicks and touch events. Activities can be started and stopped by other components, such as other activities or services.

2. Services: Services are used for background processing and long-running operations that do not require a user interface. They are used to perform tasks such as downloading files or playing music, and they can run in the background even when the application is not in the foreground.

3. Broadcast Receivers: Broadcast Receivers are used to listen for system-wide events, such as network connectivity changes or battery low warnings. They are also used to receive and respond to custom broadcast messages that are sent by other components.

4. Content Providers: Content Providers are used to manage shared data between different applications. They provide a way for applications to securely access and share data, such as contacts, media files, or calendar events.

In addition to these core components, Android also includes several other components that can be used to enhance the functionality of an application. These include:

1. Fragments: Fragments are used to build flexible and dynamic user interfaces. They can be combined together to create multi-pane layouts and can be reused across different activities.

2. Intents: Intents are used to start activities, services, and broadcast receivers. They are used to initiate communication between different components and to pass data between them.

3. App Widgets: App Widgets are small, interactive components that can be placed on the home screen or lock screen of an Android device. They provide quick access to information and functionality without the need to open an application.

Overall, the Android component model provides a flexible and modular approach to building applications. It allows developers to create complex and feature-rich applications by combining and reusing different components in a variety of ways.



Sure, here are examples of all the main Android components with code:

1. **Activities** (UI = xml and UX java file)

Activities are the main building blocks of an Android app. They represent a single screen in the app and handle user interactions, such as button clicks and touch events. Here is an example of an Activity component in Android:

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        // Add your code here
    }
}
```

2. **Services** (without UI tasks are done)

Services are used for background processing and long-running operations that do not require a user interface. They are used to perform tasks such as downloading files or playing music, and they can run in the background even when the application is not in the foreground. Here is an example of a Service component in Android:

```java
public class MyService extends Service {

    @Override
    public int onStartCommand(Intent intent, int flags, int startId) {
        // Add your code here
        return START_STICKY;
    }

    @Nullable
    @Override
    public IBinder onBind(Intent intent) {
        return null;
    }
}
```

3. **Broadcast Receivers** (basically  if we want listen all  messages or call then we do this to listen this)

Broadcast Receivers are used to listen for system-wide events, such as network connectivity changes or battery low warnings. They are also used to receive and respond to custom broadcast messages that are sent by other components. Here is an example of a Broadcast Receiver component in Android:

```java
public class MyReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {

    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        // Add your code here
    }
}
```

4. **Content Providers**

Content Providers are used to manage shared data between different applications. They provide a way for applications to securely access and share data, such as contacts, media files, or calendar events. Here is an example of a Content Provider component in Android:

```java
public class MyContentProvider extends ContentProvider {

    @Override
    public boolean onCreate() {
        // Add your code here
        return false;
    }

    @Nullable
    @Override
    public Cursor query(Uri uri, String[] projection, String selection, String[] selectionArgs, String sortOrder) {
        return null;
    }

    @Nullable
    @Override
    public String getType(Uri uri) {
        return null;
    }

    @Nullable
    @Override
    public Uri insert(Uri uri, ContentValues values) {
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public int delete(Uri uri, String selection, String[] selectionArgs) {
        return 0;
    }

    @Override
    public int update(Uri uri, ContentValues values, String selection, String[] selectionArgs) {
        return 0;
    }
}
```

5. **Fragments**

Fragments are used to build flexible and dynamic user interfaces. They can be combined together to create multi-pane layouts and can be reused across different activities. Here is an example of a Fragment component in Android:

```java
public class MyFragment extends Fragment {

    @Nullable
    @Override
    public View onCreateView(@NonNull LayoutInflater inflater, @Nullable ViewGroup container, @Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        // Inflate the layout for this fragment
        View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_my, container, false);

        // Add your code here

        return view;
    }
}
```

6. **Intents**

Intents are used to start activities, services, and broadcast receivers. They are used to initiate communication between different components and to pass data between them. Here is an example of an Intent component in Android:

```java
Intent intent = new Intent(MainActivity.this, MyActivity.class); 
intent.putExtra("key", "value"); 
startActivity(intent);
