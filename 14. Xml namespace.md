These lines of code define XML namespaces in an Android layout file:

```
xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com./apk/res/android"
xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
```

An XML namespace is a way to differentiate elements and attributes in an XML document. It allows you to define elements and attributes that have the same names as other elements and attributes without causing conflicts.

In Android, the `xmlns:android` namespace is used to define elements and attributes that are part of the Android framework. This includes attributes such as `layout_width`, `layout_height`, and `id` that are used to define the layout and behavior of UI components.

The `xmlns:app` namespace is used to define custom attributes for a specific Android application or library. This allows you to define custom attributes that can be used by components within your app or library.

The `xmlns:tools` namespace is used to define attributes that are only used during the development process, and are not included in the final app package. These attributes are used for previewing and designing the layout of UI components in the Android Studio layout editor, and are typically used to hide or modify elements during design time.

Overall, defining these XML namespaces is an important part of creating Android layouts and allows developers to define custom attributes and use built-in Android attributes without causing naming conflicts.
