Integrated Development Environment

An IDE is a software application that provides a comprehensive environment for software development. It typically includes tools for writing, debugging, and testing code, as well as features for managing source code repositories and building and deploying software.

IDEs are designed to streamline the software development process by providing a centralized interface for all aspects of development. This can include features such as syntax highlighting and code completion to help developers write code more efficiently, as well as debugging tools to help identify and fix errors in code.
