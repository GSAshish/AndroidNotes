Android architecture is the structural design of the Android operating system, which is divided into four main layers: 

1. Linux Kernel: This layer is the foundation of the Android operating system and provides the core system services such as memory management, process management, security, network stack, and driver model.

2. Libraries: This layer includes a set of libraries written in Java that provides the core features of the Android operating system, such as graphics rendering, database access, and web browsing. Some of the important libraries in this layer are the Android Runtime (ART), the Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM), and the Android Support Library.

3. Framework: This layer provides the fundamental building blocks for creating Android applications, including the UI components, activity manager, content providers, and package manager. It also includes the Android system services such as location, telephony, and media playback.

4. Applications: This layer consists of the user-facing applications that run on the Android operating system. These applications include pre-installed applications such as the phone, contacts, and messaging apps, as well as third-party applications that are downloaded from the Google Play Store or other sources.

The Android architecture is designed to be open and flexible, allowing developers to build their own applications using the same building blocks that are used to create the core Android system. This architecture also supports a wide range of devices with different screen sizes and hardware capabilities, making it a popular choice for mobile app development.

Sure, I can explain each layer of the Android architecture in more detail:

1. Linux Kernel: The Linux kernel is the heart of the Android operating system, providing the low-level services needed for hardware abstraction, process management, and security. The kernel is responsible for managing the system resources such as the CPU, memory, and input/output operations, and provides the framework for device drivers and hardware interfaces. The Android operating system uses the Linux kernel because it is open-source, widely used, and well-supported.

2. Libraries: The Libraries layer includes a set of core libraries written in Java that provide the essential features of the Android operating system. These libraries include the Android Runtime (ART), the Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM), and the Android Support Library. The ART is the default runtime environment for Android, and it compiles code into native machine code at runtime for improved performance. The DVM is an older runtime environment that is being phased out in favor of ART. The Android Support Library provides backward compatibility for older versions of Android, allowing developers to use new features on older devices.

3. Framework: The Framework layer provides the fundamental building blocks for creating Android applications. This layer includes the UI components, activity manager, content providers, and package manager. The UI components provide the interface elements that users see and interact with, such as buttons, text fields, and menus. The activity manager manages the lifecycle of the application, allowing the application to respond appropriately to changes in the environment such as screen orientation. Content providers allow applications to share data between themselves, while the package manager provides the mechanism for installing, updating, and removing applications.

4. Applications: The Applications layer consists of the user-facing applications that run on the Android operating system. These applications include pre-installed applications such as the phone, contacts, and messaging apps, as well as third-party applications that are downloaded from the Google Play Store or other sources. Android applications are written in Java, and they use the Android SDK to access the APIs provided by the Android operating system. Android applications can access a wide range of features and services, such as GPS, camera, and internet connectivity.

Overall, the Android architecture is designed to be open and flexible, allowing developers to build their own applications using the same building blocks that are used to create the core Android system. This architecture also supports a wide range of devices with different screen sizes and hardware capabilities, making it a popular choice for mobile app development.
