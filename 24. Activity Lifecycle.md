In Android, the `Activity` class is a fundamental component that represents a single screen with a user interface. Each `Activity` goes through a series of lifecycle events as it transitions between different states. Understanding the activity lifecycle is important for building robust Android applications.

Here are the different stages of the activity lifecycle in Android:

1. **Created**: The activity is created by the system, but it is not yet visible to the user.
2. **Started**: The activity becomes visible to the user, but it may not be in the foreground and may be partially obscured by another activity.
3. **Resumed**: The activity is in the foreground and has user focus. At this stage, the activity is running and interacting with the user.
4. **Paused**: The activity loses focus and is partially obscured. At this stage, the activity is still visible, but the user cannot interact with it.
5. **Stopped**: The activity is no longer visible to the user and has been removed from the foreground.
6. **Destroyed**: The activity is destroyed by the system or by the user.

During these different stages of the lifecycle, the `Activity` class provides a number of callback methods that developers can override to perform custom logic and handle state changes. These methods include:

- `onCreate()`: called when the activity is first created.
- `onStart()`: called when the activity becomes visible to the user.
- `onResume()`: called when the activity is in the foreground and has user focus.
- `onPause()`: called when the activity loses focus but is still visible to the user.
- `onStop()`: called when the activity is no longer visible to the user.
- `onDestroy()`: called when the activity is destroyed by the system or by the user.

Here is an example of how you can implement these methods in your `Activity`:

```java
public class MyActivity extends Activity {
    
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        // Perform initial setup tasks.
    }
    
    @Override
    protected void onStart() {
        super.onStart();
        // Connect to any services or resources needed.
    }
    
    @Override
    protected void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        // Start or resume any animations, music, or other UI updates.
    }
    
    @Override
    protected void onPause() {
        super.onPause();
        // Pause any animations, music, or other UI updates.
    }
    
    @Override
    protected void onStop() {
        super.onStop();
        // Release any resources that are not needed while the activity is stopped.
    }
    
    @Override
    protected void onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy();
        // Perform final cleanup tasks.
    }
}
```
